# Large Test Document

This is a large markdown file used for performance testing.

## Section 1

### Subsection 1.1

Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.

- Bullet point one with some additional text to make it longer
- Bullet point two with even more text to increase the size
- Bullet point three continuing the pattern
- Bullet point four keeping up the momentum
- Bullet point five almost there

### Subsection 1.2

1. First item in ordered list with description
2. Second item with more content here
3. Third item continuing the list
4. Fourth item almost done
5. Fifth item wrapping up

## Section 2

More content here to increase file size. The purpose is to test editor performance with larger documents.

```javascript
function example() {
  const data = {
    name: 'test',
    value: 42,
    nested: {
      deep: {
        property: true
      }
    }
  };
  return data;
}
```

## Section 3

**Bold text** and *italic text* and `inline code` mixed together in various combinations throughout this paragraph to test formatting performance.

> This is a blockquote with multiple lines of text.
> It continues here with more content.
> And here is the third line.

## Section 4

| Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   | Cell 3   |
| Cell 4   | Cell 5   | Cell 6   |
| Cell 7   | Cell 8   | Cell 9   |

## Section 5

Here is even more content to make this document larger. Each section adds to the overall size of the document which helps test performance characteristics of the editor.

### Task Lists

- [x] Completed task one
- [x] Completed task two
- [ ] Pending task three
- [ ] Pending task four

## Section 6

Final section with concluding text. This document should be large enough to show any performance issues with document serialization on each keystroke.
